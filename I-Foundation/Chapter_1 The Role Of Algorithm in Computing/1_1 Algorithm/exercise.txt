Designing disctrict. Such as for a mail-deliverying company, it has several of depots/warehouse and 
requires an office for the corresponding depots. Finding the convex hull for that several of depots/warehouse
can be used for planing, partition disctrict among city, state.

Memory usage. Steps of computation.

Array.
    Strength: 
        1. Easy to implement.
        2. Constant time look up if known the position.
        3. Constant time for insert, delete element at the end of array.
    Limitation:
        1. Fixed size. (however can be fixed by implement a realloacte function)
        2. O(n) time to insert, delete a particular element if not at the end of array. Limit it's flexibility.
        3. Hard to maintain a sorted list. Thus searching element would be diffcuit.

Similarilty. Both question require to find a path with shortest distance.
Difference. Traversing Salesman have to go through all nodes while shortest distance do not have such restriction
