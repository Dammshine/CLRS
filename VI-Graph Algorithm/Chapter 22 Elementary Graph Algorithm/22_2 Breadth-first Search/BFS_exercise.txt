Consider if gray is removed from algorithm.
The the process of BFS(s, v) is
1. Initialize on s. Mark s as black
2. Dequeue()
    1. Inspect white cell
    2. enqueue white cell
    3. mark cell as black.

This will work, because only uses for gray is to differentiate between inspected and discovered. However, 
by using white and black as indicator, every vertice will only be enqueue once and dequeue once. 
If two color is suffcient, then it only require one bit.

In adjeency matrix, scan edge took O(V).
In above cases, it have while loop that require visit each node only once, and scan the edges once per each node.
Initialization is O(v). 
Thus, the running time would be O(V^2).
