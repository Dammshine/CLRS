# Minimum Spanning tree #

Minimum spanning tree is target to a connected, undirected, weighted graph. It wishes to find a acylic graph(or just a graph since cycle garunteed to have more edge) that have total weight of edges minimise.

# The generic method of finding MST#
At first, any weighted connected graph have MST. Think as a collection of connected graph that do not have cycle, always pick the lowest weight. Secondly, if the weight of edge in graph is unique, then there exist an unique MST.
